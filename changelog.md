# v6.01
- Re-implemented automatic checking for updates.
- Fixed an issue where the version wasn't updated on the client, causing an infinite "A new version is available" loop.
- Fixed an issue with the status command where the `playing` type would not work correctly.
- Fixed issues where some commands would not delete the summoning message.
