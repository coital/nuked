# FAQ
- Q: Will I need to install packages via requirements.txt?
  - A: Usually not, Nuked has a ["package manager"](https://github.com/coital/nuked/tree/main/modules/package.py) that will attempt to automatically install missing packages. Sometimes, it will fail to install a missing package, which is when you will need to manually install it.
