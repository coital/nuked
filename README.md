# FAQ

- Q: Will I need to install packages via requirements.txt?
  - A: Usually not, Nuked has a ["package manager"](https://github.com/coital/nuked/tree/main/modules/package.py) that will attempt to automatically install missing packages. Sometimes, it will fail to install a missing package, which is when you will need to manually install it.

- Q: Is there a specific terminal I need to use for Nuked?
  - A: Not really, although I would prefer you to use [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) if you're using Windows.

- Q: Does Nuked automatically install updates?
  - A: It will notify you if there is a new update, but it does not automatically install the update itself. It leaves you to decide whether or not you want to update. Automatic update notifications can be turned off in config.json.

- Q: How frequent will updates release?
  - A: Daily, weekly, or monthly. It all depends. However, full feature updates (x.1, x.2) will take longer to release than smaller updates (x.01, x.02).

- Q: Is there a feature roadmap?
  - A: Nope, and I do not intend to create one.

- Q: Does it work on Linux?
  - A: Yes, it works on Linux and Windows, without needing code to be altered by the user.
