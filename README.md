# FAQ
- Q: Will I need to install packages via requirements.txt?
  - A: Usually not, Nuked has a ["package manager"](https://github.com/coital/nuked/tree/main/modules/package.py) that will attempt to automatically install missing packages. Sometimes, it will fail to install a missing package, which is when you will need to manually install it.

- Q: Is there a specific terminal I need to use for Nuked?
  - A: Not really, although I would prefer you to use [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/p/windows-terminal) if you're using Windows.
